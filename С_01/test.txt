Jinn! Always the Jinn, always take one on the chin
The devil dogs and scorpions peel away and wear my skin

Smokeless flame, the common name
Less than the angels but more of the same
No paradise, no gre'thor will lay their claim
Whether the intentions are violent or just mundane

With the wind he disappeared
Confirming everything that I feared
The time passed is shown by the length of his beard
